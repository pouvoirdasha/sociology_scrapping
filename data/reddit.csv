","Honestly I think it was really smart! It’s going to get a ton of Gen Z and younger millennials rooting for especially those that were wishy washy about Biden in regard to his cognitive abilities, age, etc. I think this is her showing that she is very far from that and understands young voters/what we like. I think whether or not they’ll actually vote is another issue that deals more with the fact that many Gen-Zers aren’t even registered to vote. I hope she keeps this up and further uses her platform to get them to register and to the polls. I think middle aged/older Democrats were on board with her from the very beginning and even before Biden dropped out so she’s fine with that demographic. It’s moderates and Republicans that aren’t pro-Trump that I think she needs to cater to next.",55

","I love the fact that she's owning this and other memes, like 'coconut tree' and her obsession with Venn Diagrams. Not only for Gen Z but some of. us older folks (Gen X and upwards) love the memes too. Shows she's not taking herself too seriously which will help her when the sexism and racism start coming her way (which they already are). Incidentally, if elected she'll be the first president younger than I am.",29
Tbearbean,"I agree with everything others have said and will add that since her campaign is going to be so short/a sprint to Election Day, tying into a pop culture moment gives the “most bang for the buck” in terms of getting excitement and momentum fast. She doesn’t need a campaign design that will last her for 2 years of stumping. She really just needs to win the internet between now and Election Day which is what she is doing",11
gshruff91,"I think it could energise that youthful base who will spread content online and hopefully engage their parents. I guess the plan is to mobilise that youthful base early and hope they would have the staying power because at some point she will need to pivot and mature to an older audience because half of Gen Z aren’t 18 yet and ‘young people don’t vote’. I think the black and Hispanic voters will be a more nuanced challenge - Trump/MAGA resonates with some of those groups. Being a prosecutor might work for white middle America and hard on sexual assault will also be important with women (alongside abortion) but this was also during the 90s a period which kicked off mass incarceration and devastated many families and communities, I think she needs a good answer on that to show how her thinking has evolved.",5
purplelikethesky,"I think it’s a great example of what Hillary tried and failed to do. Hillary never had that personality or lightheartedness that Kamala does, so when she leaned into the memes it came across as cringe.

","As long as it’s treated like any other PR campaign with multiple levels to the marketing funnel. As someone who is older Gen X I had to look up both references. This will energize younger voters who they need, but it can’t be done at the expense of the huge swath of older voters who may appreciate the new energy, but will still need to connect with her. That said, I have confidence especially is a few of the organizers from Obama’s campaign join in as the reporting indicates.",3
sewer_pickles,"It’s a good way to further position herself as the “youthful” candidate. I see it as one of many message tracks targeted at specific demographics. For example, it was announced that she has an agreement with Beyoncé to use one of her songs as her campaign anthem. That allows her to connect with women and African American voters. And all of this won’t alienate older voters, so there’s no real harm in it.",2
Leather_Classic9809,"For the initial launch, yes it's funny, but at the same time...
1. Messaging wise: do we want the Democratic presidential candidate to have a feral party girl summer?
2. Trends in PR die quickly... they need to have a backup plan for when this goes south.
3. Media outlets are referring to this as the ""Harris honeymoon phase"" and you can argue that the success this has gotten so far really speaks to that. If another candidate tried launching something similar without her credentials or platform, it would fall flat.

","tl;dr It is effective branding precisely because of how nakedly pop culture it is, strategically avoiding any policy related branding, just ""vibes""
Long Answer:
Many if not most Americans don't study propaganda, geopolitics, relationship between money, MIC, donor class, lobbying, and duopoly endless wars, which Kamala Harris has shown to be mute on, either because she is inexperienced, or does not want to be on record for. No other explanation for 20 years of endless wars that has killed millions of mostly brown people in the middle east, trillions of dollars wasted, while stock market skyrockets from 2002-2022, YET most Americans can't afford a $1,000 emergency, have ever increasing cost of living like rent, food etc., can't buy a home, have shitty, bankrupting, or no health care, and tied to your job, paid family leave, AND an ever expanding homeless class, forgotten and swept under the rug.
Its smart because people are easily manipulated. Kamala is a rebranded cypher, you see in her what the media will allow you to see(her track record be damned). She has a glorified donation/merch store with ""how to deploy propaganda effectively"" sections among the usual ""about"" pages and data collection, YET no bullet points on her policies and what she actually believes in, concretely in terms of domestic policy, and foreign policy. Given her frequent flip flopping during the 2020 election in which she won zero delegates and had to drop out before California primary, her home state., its fair question to ask why she doesn't have this, is she waiting to get marching orders now from her former Blackrock and Banking buddies as was recently reported she was meeting with?
Americans are some of the most propagandized people on planet earth, thank you Edward Bernays(your dark art has done great harm in the hands of corporations/govt.)and don't know how propagandized they are as the duopoly siphons more of YOUR wealth for themselves, often through endless money printing, endless wars, donor class bought politicians turning a blind eye to rigged monopoly system of the USA.
Also, I hope you have fun sending 20 billion dollars of your tax payer money to Israel, passed by President ""Uncle Joe"" Biden this week, as Israel continues to bomb Gaza to smithereens, allow polio to spread, wipe out entire families, and tried by international law by ICC and ICJ as plausible genocide, and other documented war crimes that are unspeakable in this sub reddit to go into detail about, reported in ISRAELI MEDIA. American workers get all the blowback of this, and none of the benefit, this ain't the 50's when USA ruled the a world made rubble by WW2, USA IS IN DECLINE because your ""team blue"" and ""team red"" leaders decided to use budget surplus from the 1990s for endless illegal horrific wars, wall street wealth consolidation among a few, and deregulation to make sure you live in an inverted totalitarian state bought off by corporate monopolies, hidden to you if you live in a Disney like fantasy.
Gen Z, you obviously know you where born in an ever increasingly volatile Western world, because of the above, so ""VIBES"" is ALL the politician will give you inside the duopoly, THEY HAVE NOTHING else to offer you as they lead naive and propagandized Americans, on either ""team"", like lambs to the slaughter. Oh and we are at risk of regional war in Middle East right now, that could go nuclear, same for Ukraine proxy war, largest land war since WW2.
But remember Kamala is ""brat"" and really cares about working families ability to make it. ""Build more schools not jails, build more schools not jails"", she said with a mocking tone, on camera.",1

Praxistor,i'm too scared to ask what it means...,79
actually-I-am-god,"to answer both of you, brat is the name of an album by the musician Charli XCX, who is very popular with Gen Z. around the beginning of Kamala’s campaign, Charli XCX tweeted out “Kamala is brat”. Charli XCX explained brat on social media: “You’re just like that girl who is a little messy and likes to party and maybe says some dumb things sometimes. Who feels like herself but maybe also has a breakdown. But kind of like parties through it, is very honest, very blunt. A little bit volatile. Like, does dumb things. But it’s brat. You’re brat. That’s brat.” Charli XCX calling Kamala “brat” is a way of endorsing her in the eyes of Gen Z and cementing her as the cooler, younger candidate who isn’t perfect but is aware of that, and likes to have fun. edit: misspelled Charli’s name",224
airhostessnthe60s,So she's a real person. Got it! No wonder the Q factor is off the charts with her.,90
Awkward_Potential_,John Lovett from Pod Save America also said that the fact that she wasn't actually running for president is helping her. People hate when a woman is seen as ambitious. It's misogynist but it helps this time so good I guess?,41
monsieurxander,"That's definitely a factor, but I think a bigger one is skipping primary season where candidates attack each other for a full year and then have just a couple of months to unify.",46
lucolaptic,It’s such a bad system. We need shorter election cycles badly.,18
OGMom2022,After this I couldn’t agree more. Three months is plenty of time.,6

airhostessnthe60s,"Take people like him with all grains of salt. Just bc he is sometimes right about some stuff doesn't make him insightful about other stuff - even if the correlation seems to be true.

I agree in 2024, she has the whole thing about ""the ones who can best exercise power are not those seeking power but the ones where power is thrust upon them"".",1
yamthepowerful,"I hadn’t thought of this, but it’s so true.",1
TonyzTone,"Not for nothing, but based on how Charli XCX (no ""e"" at the end of Charli) defines it, Kamala is definitely does not sound ""brat.""

But if it Gen Zers thinks so, then what do I know.",17
actually-I-am-god,"i think the point is that in comparison to the opponent (who, in the eyes of GenZ is very much the more hard-ass, angry, and miserable of the options), she looks like the fun-loving aunt drinking wine and avoiding drama. she’s definitely not the picture of “brat”, but she’s far closer to it than anyone else running.",11
OrangeZig,"It’s more an aesthetic and she’s being a bit ironic about Kamala, in a positive playful way. It’s like saying she’s cool. Watch her music videos to understand. It’s not a literal definition.",18
TRANSBIANGODDES,"It’s not a literal hard definition. It’s meant to have a positive connotation

Praxistor,sounds like gen x,12
iamaravis,"With that description, it sure sounds like an insult.",1
Dana07620,"I've seen that explanation before. And I still fail to understand how that's a compliment or a positive. Even though I know it's supposed to be.

Now if he had said, ""It's someone who's stubborn and opinionated and speaks their minds on the right things and sticks with their principles even when it annoys people who wished they'd shut their mouth,"" that I would see as a compliment.

But messy, likes to party, says and does dumb things, volatile, has breakdowns but is honest and blunt...the bad outweighs the good there. Especially since it sounds liked they'd use being honest and blunt to cover when they're being an asshole who just said / did something dumb and is having a breakdown being called out on it.

And I say that as someone who had no problem understanding when ""You look bad"" went from being an insult to a compliment.",-1
Nosretepm,"Just a gentle correction, Charli xcx is a female singer. Doesn’t change the definition but it becomes slightly more palpable, lol",4

bubs713,"I looked it up and it’s not bad haha:

In modern pop culture, the word brat refers to someone who is confidently rebellious, unapologetically bold, and playfully defiant. This new definition celebrates individuality and a carefree attitude, often with a hint of sass and a love for fun. Being labeled “a brat” or “bratty” in this context is more of a compliment, recognizing a person’s ability to challenge norms and express themselves freely without concern for conventional expectations.",40
OrangeZig,Yeah this is a better explanation,6
McTootyBooty,Brat is the new queen 👸,1
i-love-elephants,You don't get the essence of brat summer.,9
unipole,"Don't worry, for us older folk the ""Walz is grilling brats"" meme is coming.",6
RedditMapz,"Brat basically means : you are that messy party girl, but you are the it girl.

These answers are painful to read. Even Gen Z doesn't know what it means... As pop head gay millennial here it goes:

In the 2010s millennials gave rise to a subgenre of music called Brat Pop. The sound is high energy with a tipsy girl sound (Usually fast with some talk-singing or shout-singing). You could say Kesha invented it. A lot of independent artists at the time created a lot of brat pop songs. I don't Care is pretty much the brat pop sound.

Charlie XCX has long been branded as the quintessential Brat Pop artist. With this album she owned the term Brat, but also brought it to the mainstream. Being underground most people don't know what it means. Now it is used as slang to evoke the ethos of the Brat Pop energy of a person. Of course most people know fuck all about pop music or Charlie XCX decade long music history",5

Missfreeland,It’s just a vibe from her newest album BRAT she’s a club party girl that makes fun music enjoyed by club goers and gay dudes. This album broke through the periphery of pop this summer and became a new trend. It’s just fun. I’ve been enjoying it with my wife and our friends,15
