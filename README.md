## Sociology of the Digital Public Space

This code was written for a school project at Sciences Po's school of Public Affairs. In our course of Sociology of the Digital Public Space, we set to study the Brat Summer trend with a mixed-methods (quantitative *and* qualitative analysis) approach.

This code is the reflection of the more quantitative part, where:
- we conduct data scraping on YouTube and TikTok
- we perform descriptive statistics
- we finetune [cardiffnlp's multinlingual sentiment analysis model](https://huggingface.co/cardiffnlp/twitter-xlm-roberta-base-sentiment-multilingual)
- and we plot graphs to visualize results.

Do not hesitate to contact us for any question.
